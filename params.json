{"name":"Usblock","tagline":"Lock and unlock your desktop using a USB stick as a key","body":"=======\r\nUSBLock\r\n=======\r\n\r\nCopyright (C) 2013  Sven Steinbauer http://www.unlogic.co.uk\r\n\r\nUSBlock is a Python script that will lock and unlock your linux box using any \r\nold USB storage device as a key.\r\n\r\n** NOTE **\r\nV0.1 only works on Linux. OS X and Windows will have to wait a little.\r\n\r\nNon Python dependencies\r\n=======================\r\n\r\nLinux\r\n-----\r\n\r\nYou will need `dbus` and `python-dbus` as well as `hal`. These should all be \r\navailable via your package manager. See below why `python-dbus` is listed here.\r\n\r\nKnown Issues\r\n============\r\n\r\n* I've had some devices not mount on external USB ports (like on a Mac keyboard\r\nor hub). DBus does not register the device insertion and so USBLock cannot\r\nlock or unlock your machine. Try a different memory stick or USB port.\r\n\r\n* On linux you need dbus installed. `pip install dbus-python` doesn't work, so \r\nyou may have to install it via your system's package manager or from source.\r\n\r\nThanks for the patches\r\n======================\r\n\r\nJoel Semar, Natan L\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
